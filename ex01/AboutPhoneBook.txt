Perfect 👍
ex01 deserves a deep explanation — this is the exercise where most 42 students either understand OOP or get stuck later.

I’ll do exactly what you asked:

✅ Step-by-step plan (what to do, in order)

✅ All important edge cases the grader will test

❌ No code

Think of this like a mental checklist you follow while coding.

CPP00 – ex01 (PhoneBook) — FULL GUIDED PLAN
1️⃣ Before writing ANY code: understand the rules

This exercise simulates a real terminal application.

You have only 3 commands:

ADD

SEARCH

EXIT

Anything else:

❌ must NOT crash

❌ must NOT behave weirdly

💡 Edge case #1
User enters random text → program must ignore it and continue.

2️⃣ Global architecture (VERY IMPORTANT)

You must create 2 classes:

📌 Contact

Represents ONE person

📌 PhoneBook

Manages UP TO 8 contacts

Think like this:

PhoneBook is the boss
Contact is just data

3️⃣ Contact class — how to design it
Step 3.1: Decide what must be PRIVATE

These fields MUST be private:

first name

last name

nickname

phone number

darkest secret

💡 Why private?
Because the subject wants encapsulation.
Direct access = ❌ fail mindset.

Step 3.2: How will data enter a Contact?

A Contact:

starts empty

then gets filled by input

So you need:

a way to set all fields

a way to read fields safely

💡 Edge case #2
Empty input (user presses ENTER)
→ You must refuse it and ask again.

4️⃣ PhoneBook class — design logic
Step 4.1: Storage logic

Rules:

Max = 8 contacts

If full → overwrite the oldest

So PhoneBook must track:

current index (0 → 7)

total contacts stored

💡 Edge case #3
User adds more than 8 contacts
→ Old contacts are replaced in order

Step 4.2: ADD command logic

When user types ADD:

You must:

Ask for all 5 fields

Validate each input

Store contact at correct index

Update index correctly

💡 Edge case #4
User enters spaces only
→ Consider it empty → reject

5️⃣ SEARCH command — MOST TRICKY PART

This is where many students fail.

Step 5.1: Display summary table

You must print:

Index

First name

Last name

Nickname

Each column:

Width = 10

Right-aligned

Truncated if >10 characters

💡 Edge case #5
Name longer than 10 characters
→ Show first 9 + .

Example:

Christopher → Christoph.

Step 5.2: No contacts yet

💡 Edge case #6
User types SEARCH before ADD

Correct behavior:

Print nothing OR message

Must NOT crash

Step 5.3: Index selection

After showing table:

Ask user for index

Validate it

Validation rules:

Must be a number

Must exist

Must be inside range

💡 Edge case #7
User enters:

letter

negative number

out-of-range number

→ Must reject and return safely

Step 5.4: Display full contact

Once index is valid:

Print all 5 fields

No truncation

6️⃣ Input handling — VERY IMPORTANT
Rule:

Never trust user input.

Use:

std::getline

Avoid:

Mixing cin >> and getline

💡 Edge case #8
User presses Ctrl+D (EOF)
→ Program must exit cleanly.

This is a classic 42 test.

7️⃣ Program loop (main logic)

Your program must:

Start

Wait for command

Execute command

Loop until EXIT

💡 Edge case #9
EXIT must:

free memory automatically

end program cleanly

8️⃣ Object lifecycle (hidden check)

Even if not visible:

Constructors are called

Destructors are called

The grader expects:

No dynamic memory

No leaks

Clean object creation

9️⃣ Common mistakes that FAIL students ❌

❌ Using global variables
❌ Using struct instead of class
❌ Public class attributes
❌ Crashing on bad input
❌ Hardcoding values
❌ Not respecting formatting

10️⃣ Mental checklist before submission ✅

Ask yourself:

Can my program survive any random input?

Can I add 20 contacts without crash?

Does SEARCH work when empty?

Is my output exactly formatted?

Are fields private?

If yes → you’re ready.
